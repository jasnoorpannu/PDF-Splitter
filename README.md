## PDF Splitter Project: PyPDF2 Splitter

### Project Introduction

Welcome to the PDF Splitter Project! This Python script, using the PyPDF2 library, provides a straightforward solution for splitting PDF files into smaller segments based on user-defined page ranges. Whether you need to extract specific chapters or sections from a larger document, this tool simplifies the process with ease.

### Features

- **Custom Page Ranges:** Define ranges (e.g., "1-3, 5-8") to extract specific pages from a PDF.
- **Output Naming:** Each extracted segment is saved with a user-defined name for easy identification.
- **Error Handling:** Alerts for out-of-range pages to ensure accurate extraction.

### Detailed Workflow

1. **Input PDF:** Select any PDF file for splitting.
2. **Page Ranges:** Input ranges and name each segment for extraction.
3. **Output Directory:** Save split PDF segments to a specified folder.

### How It Works

Using PyPDF2, the script reads the input PDF, extracts specified pages according to user-defined ranges, and saves each segment as a separate PDF file. It handles varying page counts gracefully and ensures all extracted segments are correctly saved.

### Conclusion

This PyPDF2 Splitter project offers a practical solution for anyone needing to manage and extract specific sections from PDF documents. Whether you're working with lengthy reports or educational materials, this tool enhances document management efficiency.
